## Installation

Installation on _Linux_ and _MacOS_ is simple:
```sh
pip3 install PyFlyt
```

On _Windows_, additional installation may be required for various Microsoft C++ components.

## Gymnasium Environments

If all you want are the Gymnasium environments, you can skip everything and go straight to the [Gymnasium Environments](documentation/gym_envs) section.

## I want to do more!

A set of helpful examples are provided in [the source repository](https://github.com/jjshoots/PyFlyt/tree/master/examples/core).
While this documentation provides a detailed overview of PyFlyt, the examples can bring you 80% of the way to a fully fledged user in a couple hours.
New users are highly encouraged to go through them first.

## Help Needed!

Should you encounter any difficulty in doing so, don't hesitate to [get in touch](https://github.com/jjshoots/PyFlyt/issues)!
