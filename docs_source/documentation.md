## Installation

Installation on _Linux_ and _MacOS_ is simple:

On _Windows_, additional installation may be required for various Microsoft C++ components.

## Custom Drones

If you're interested in constructing your own drone, the best place to get started would be by going through the [examples section](https://github.com/jjshoots/PyFlyt/tree/master/examples/core).
First, read the [aviary documentation](documentation/core/aviary.md), then the [custom drone example](https://github.com/jjshoots/PyFlyt/blob/master/examples/core/07_custom_uav.py),
which demonstrates how to construct a custom drone using various pre-implemented components, listed in the [abstractions](documentation/core/abstractions) section.

Should you encounter any difficulty in doing so, don't hesitate to [get in touch](https://github.com/jjshoots/PyFlyt/issues)!

## Gymnasium Environments

If all you want are the Gymnasium environments, you can skip everything and go straight to the [Gymnasium Environments](documentation/gym_envs) section.
